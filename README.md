# Server mode (Pass directory to serve)
npx @marp-team/marp-cli -s ./slides

# Open converted HTML in preview window
npx @marp-team/marp-cli -p slide-deck.md
```

> :information_source: You have to install [Google Chrome] (or [Chromium]) to convert slide deck into PDF.

[google chrome]: https://www.google.com/chrome/
[chromium]: https://www.chromium.org/

### Docker

Do you hate to install node/chrome locally? We have [an official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/marpteam/marp-cli/) ready to use CLI.

```bash
# Convert slide deck into HTML
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/home/marp/app/ -e LANG=$LANG marpteam/marp-cli slide-deck.md

# Convert slide deck into PDF by using Chromium in Docker
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/home/marp/app/ -e LANG=$LANG marpteam/marp-cli slide-deck.md --pdf

# Watch mode
docker run --rm --init -v $PWD:/home/marp/app/ -e LANG=$LANG -p 52000:52000 marpteam/marp-cli -w slide-deck.md

# Server mode (Serve current directory)
docker run --rm --init -v $PWD:/home/marp/app -e LANG=$LANG -p 8080:8080 -p 52000:52000 marpteam/marp-cli -s .
```

## Install

### Local installation

We recommend to install Marp CLI into your Node project. You may control the CLI (and engine) version exactly.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @marp-team/marp-cli
```

The installed `marp` command is available in [npm-scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) or `npx marp`.

### Global installation

You can install with `-g` option if you want to use `marp` command globally.

```bash
npm install -g @marp-team/marp-cli
```

### Standalone binary _(EXPERIMENTAL)_

Do you never want to install any dependent tools? we also provide executable binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows. [:fast_forward: Download the latest standalone binary for your OS from release page.](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli/releases)

## Basic usage

### Convert to HTML

The passed markdown will be converted to HTML file by default. In the below example, a converted `slide-deck.html` will output to the same directory.

```bash
marp slide-deck.md
```

You can change the output path by `--output` (`-o`) option.

```bash
marp slide-deck.md -o output.html
```

Marp CLI supports converting multiple files by passing multiple paths, directories, and glob patterns. In this case, `--output` option cannot use.

When you want to output the converted result to another directory with keeping the origin directory structure, you can use `--inpur-dir` (`-I`) option. `--output` option would be available for specify the output directory.

### Convert to PDF (`--pdf`)

If you passed `--pdf` option or the output filename specified by `--output` (`-o`) option ends with `.pdf`, Marp CLI will try to convert into PDF file by using the installed [Google Chrome] or [Chromium].

```bash
marp --pdf slide-deck.md
marp slide-deck.md -o converted.pdf
```

### Convert the first slide page to image (`--image`)

You can convert _the first page_ of targeted slide deck into an image when specified `--image [png|jpeg]` option or the output path with PNG and JPEG extensions.

```bash
# Convert the first slide page into PNG image
marp --image png slide-deck.md
marp slide-deck.md -o output.png

# Convert the first slide page into JPEG image
marp --image jpeg slide-deck.md
marp slide-deck.md -o output.jpg
```

It would be useful for creating [Open Graph] image that can specify with [`image` global directive and `--og-image` option](#metadata).

> :information_source: PDF and image conversion require [Google Chrome] or [Chromium]. When any problem has occurred while converting, please update your Chrome/Chromium to the latest version or try using [Google Chrome Canary].
>
> About known issues while converting an image, refer to [#68 comment](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli/pull/68#issuecomment-459701753).

[google chrome canary]: https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/

#### Security about local files

Because of [the security reason](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli/pull/10), **the converted PDF and images cannot use local files by default.** We recommend uploading your assets to online.

But if you want to use local files in rendered PDF, `--alow-local-files` option helps to find your local files. Warnings about using the insecure option will be outputted in each conversion.

```bash
marp --pdf --allow-local-files slide-deck.md
```

### Watch mode (`--watch` / `-w`)

Marp CLI will observe a change of Markdown / used Theme CSS when passed with `--watch` (`-w`) option. The conversion is triggered whenever the content of file is updated.

While you are opening the converted HTML in browser, it would refresh the opened page automatically.

### Server mode (`--server` / `-s`)

Server mode supports on-demand conversion by HTTP request. We require to pass `--server` (`-s`) option and a directory to serve.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marp-team/marp-cli/master/docs/images/server-mode.gif)

In this mode, the converted file outputs as the result of accessing to server, and not to disk.

You would get the converted PDF, PNG, and JPEG by adding corresponded query string when requesting. e.g. `http://localhost:8080/deck-a.md?pdf` returns converted PDF.

#### `index.md` / `PITCHME.md`

Marp CLI server will provide the list of served files by default, but you can place the default Markdown deck like a common web server's `index.html`.

Place Markdown named `index.md` or `PITCHME.md` ([GitPitch style](https://gitpitch.com/docs/getting-started/pitchme/)) to served directory. It would be redirected just accessing to `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Preview window (_Experimental:_ `--preview` / `-p`)

When conversions were executed together with `--preview` (`-p`) option, Marp CLI will open preview window(s) to check the converted result immediately.

Unlike opening with browser, you may present deck with the immersive window. [Watch mode](#watch-mode) is enabled automatically.

> :information_source: `--preview` option cannot use when you are using Marp CLI through official docker image.

## Template

You can choose a built-in HTML templates by `--template` option. Default template is `bespoke`.

```bash
marp --template bespoke slide-deck.md
```

### `bespoke` template (default)

The `bespoke` template is using [Bespoke.js](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke) as the name implies. It has several features to be useful in a real presentation. A few features may control by CLI options.

#### Features

- **Navigation**: Navigate the deck through keyboard and swipe geasture.
- **Fullscreen**: Toggle fullscreen by hitting <kbd>f</kbd> / <kbd>F11</kbd> key.
- **On-screen controller**: There is a touch-friendly OSC. You may also disable by `--bespoke-osc=false` if unneccesary.
- **Fragmented list**: Recognize [Marpit's fragmented list](https://github.com/marp-team/marpit/issues/145) and appear list one-by-one if used `*` and `1)` as the bullet marker.
- **Progress bar** (optional): By setting `--bespoke-progress` option, you can add a progress bar on the top of the deck.

### `bare` template

The `bare` template is a primitive template, and there is no extra features. It only has minimum assets to give your presentation with browser.

#### Zero-JS slide deck

When [the conversion engine is changed to Marpit framework by setting `engine` option](#use-marpit-framework), _it would not use any scripts._ Even then, it has enough to use for the browser-based presentation.

```bash
marp --template bare --engine @marp-team/marpit slide-deck.md
```

## Metadata

We recommend setting metadata of the slide deck if you want to host the outputted HTML on the web. To optimize the converted web page for SEO and social sharing, passed meta values will use in `<title>`, `<link>`, and `<meta>` tags.

| [Global directives] |   CLI option    | Description                           | Metadata                                      |
| :-----------------: | :-------------: | :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
|       `title`       |    `--title`    | Define title of the slide deck.       | `<title>`, `og:title`                         |
|    `description`    | `--description` | Define description of the slide deck. | `<meta name="description">`, `og:description` |
|        `url`        |     `--url`     | Define [canonical URL].               | `<link rel="canonical">`, `og:url`            |
|       `image`       |  `--og-image`   | Define [Open Graph] image URL.        | `og:image`                                    |

[canonical url]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element
[open graph]: http://ogp.me/

> :information_source: The passed canonical URL will be ignored when cannot parse as valid URL.

### By [global directives]

Marp CLI supports _additional [global directives]_ to specify metadata in Markdown. You can define meta values in Markdown front-matter.

```markdown
---
title: Marp slide deck
description: An example slide deck created by Marp CLI
url: https://marp.app/
image: https://marp.app/og-image.jpg
---

# Marp slide deck
```

[global directives]: https://marpit.marp.app/directives?id=global-directives-1

### By CLI option

Marp CLI prefers CLI option to global directives. You can override metadata values by `--title`, `--description`, `--url`, and `--og-image`.

## Theme

### Override theme

You can override theme you want to use by `--theme` option. For example to use [Gaia](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/tree/master/themes#gaia) built-in theme in Marp Core:

```bash
marp --theme gaia
```

### Use custom theme

A custom theme created by user also can use easily by passing the path of CSS file.

```bash
marp --theme custom-theme.css
```

> :information_source: Normally [Marpit theme CSS requires `@theme` meta comment](https://marpit.marp.app/theme-css?id=metadata), but it's not required in this usage.

### Theme set

`--theme-set` option has to specify theme set composed by multiple theme CSS files. The registed themes are usable in [Marpit's `theme` directive](https://marpit.marp.app/directives?id=theme).

```bash
# Multiple theme CSS files
marp --theme-set theme-a.css theme-b.css theme-c.css -- deck-a.md deck-b.md

# Theme directory
marp --theme-set ./themes -- deck.md
```

## Engine

Marp CLI is calling the [Marpit framework](https://marpit.marp.app/) based converter as "Engine". Normally we use the bundled [marp-core](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core), but you may swap the conversion engine to another Marpit based engine through `--engine` option.

### Use Marpit framework

For example, it can convert Markdown by using the pure Marpit framework.

```bash
# Install Marpit framework
npm i @marp-team/marpit

# Specify engine to use Marpit
marp --engine @marp-team/marpit marpit-deck.md
```

Notice that Marpit has not provided theme. It would be good to include inline style in Markdown, or pass CSS file by `--theme` option.

### Functional engine

When you specify the path to JavaScript file in `--engine` option, you may use more customized engine by JS.

It would be useful to convert with a customized engine for supporting the additional syntax that is out of Marp Markdown specification.

#### Example: [markdown-it-mark](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-mark)

```javascript
// engine.js
const { Marp } = require('@marp-team/marp-core')
const markdownItMark = require('markdown-it-mark')

module.exports = opts => new Marp(opts).use(markdownItMark)
```

```bash
# Install Marp Core and markdown-it-mark
npm install @marp-team/marp-core markdown-it-mark --save-dev

# Specify the path to functional engine
marp --engine ./engine.js slide-deck.md
```

The customized engine would convert `==marked==` to `<mark>marked</mark>`.

### Confirm engine version

By using `--version` (`-v`) option, you may confirm the version of engine that is expected to use in current configuration.

```console
$ marp --version
@marp-team/marp-cli v0.x.x (/w bundled @marp-team/marp-core v0.x.x)
```

Marp CLI prefers to use _an installed core by user_ than the bundled. If the current project has installed `@marp-team/marp-core` individually, it would show its version and the annotation "/w customized engine".

## Configuration file

Marp CLI can be configured options with file, such as `marp.config.js`, `.marprc` (JSON / YAML), and `marp` section of `package.json`. It is useful to configure settings for the whole of project.

```javascript
// package.json
{
  "marp": {
    "inputDir": "./slides",
    "output":" ./public",
    "themeSet": "./themes"
  }
}
```

```yaml
# .marprc.yml
allowLocalFiles: true
options:
  looseYAML: false
  markdown:
    breaks: false
pdf: true
```

```javascript
// marp.config.js
const { Marp } = require('@marp-team/marp-core')
const container = require('markdown-it-container')

module.exports = {
  // Customize engine on configuration file directly
  engine: opts => new Marp(opts).use(container, 'custom'),
}
```

By default we use configuration file that is placed on current directory, but you may also specify the for configuration file by `--config-file` option (`-c`).

### Advanced

The advanced options that cannot specify through CLI options can be configured by file.

#### Base options for engine constructor

`options` can specify the base options for the constructor of the used engine. You can fine-tune constructor options for [Marp Core](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core#constructor-options) / [Marpit](https://marpit-api.marp.app/marpit).

For example, this configuration disables Marp Core's line breaks conversion (`\n` to `<br />`) to match for CommonMark, by passing [markdown-it's `breaks` option](https://markdown-it.github.io/markdown-it/#MarkdownIt.new) as `false`.

```json
{
  "options": {
    "markdown": {
      "breaks": false
    }
  }
}
```

> :warning: Some options may be overridden by used template.
